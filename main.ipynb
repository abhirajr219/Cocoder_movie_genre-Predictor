            "Two years after the events in Las Vegas, Stu Price travels to Thailand for his upcoming wedding to Lauren, his fiancée, along with his three best friends Doug Billings, Phil Wenneck, and Alan Garner. Much to Alan's dismay, they are joined by Lauren's younger brother, a Stanford University scholar named Teddy. At the rehearsal dinner, Lauren's father reveals his disapproval of Stu during a toast. Later that night, Stu hesitantly joins Phil, Doug, Alan and Teddy for a beer. Sitting at a campfire and roasting marshmallows, the group toast to Stu and Lauren's future happiness.\n",
            "The following morning, Phil, Stu and Alan awaken in a filthy hotel room in Bangkok. Stu has a face tattoo (a replica of Mike Tyson's) and Alan's head is completely shaved. They meet a chain-smoking capuchin monkey and discover that their old friend, Chinese gangster Leslie Chow, followed them to Thailand on Alan's invitation. They cannot find Teddy, and discover only his severed finger. Chow begins to relay the events of the prior night, but he seemingly dies after snorting a line of cocaine. Panicked, the trio disposes of Chow's body in the hotel's ice box.\n",
            "Through a tip from Doug (who is still at the resort as he left the campfire earlier than the others), they go to a police station to pick up Teddy but are given a wheelchair containing an elderly Buddhist monk. He refuses to reveal anything, having taken a vow of silence. After finding a business card, they travel to the smoldering ruins of the business.\n",
            "They enter a nearby tattoo parlor where Stu got his tattoo, and they learn that they started a fight that escalated into a riot. The trio returns the monk to his temple, where they are encouraged by the head monk to meditate. Alan is able to recall that they had been at a strip club, where they learn that Stu was sodomized by a ladyboy. Upon exiting, the trio is attacked by two Russian mobsters who take the monkey, and one shoots Phil in his arm.\n",
            "After Phil is treated at a clinic, Alan confesses that he had drugged some of the marshmallows from the previous night with muscle relaxers and ADHD medication in order to sedate Teddy, as he feared the others were going to replace him, but accidentally mixed up the bags. Phil and Stu become furious that Alan drugged them again. Stu blames Alan for ruining his life and attacks him, but Phil breaks it up and tells them that they have to stick together. They notice something on Alan's stomach: an address and a time for a meeting. They meet a gangster named Kingsley, who demands Chow's bank account password by the following morning in exchange for Teddy. They return to the hotel to try to find Chow's password, only to discover that he is still alive. They steal the monkey, who had the code given to him and put inside his jacket for safe-keeping by Chow, back from the Russian mobsters through a violent car chase, during which the monkey is shot and injured.\n",
            "After taking the code and leaving the monkey outside a veterinary clinic, the group completes the deal with Kingsley. Interpol agents appear and arrest Chow. Kingsley turns out to be an undercover agent, who tells the trio that he doesn't actually know where Teddy is.\n",
            "Desperate, Phil calls Doug's wife Tracy to tell her they cannot find Teddy. Stu decides to call off the wedding, live in Bangkok and say that Teddy died. During a rolling blackout, Stu realizes where Teddy is. The trio rushes back to the hotel to find Teddy who is in the elevator. Teddy had woken up earlier than the others but became trapped after the power went out. The four use Chow's speedboat to travel back to the wedding reception.\n",
            "Arriving just as Lauren's father is about to cancel the wedding, Stu makes a defiant speech where he rejects being a boring dentist and instead insists he is quite wild. Impressed, Lauren's father gives the couple his blessing. Alan presents Stu with a special gift at the reception: a musical guest performance by Mike Tyson. Teddy later discovers that he had taken many pictures during the night on his cell phone before the battery died. The group, along with Tyson, agree to look at the pictures together once before deleting them. The photos reveal Teddy  [['The Hangover Part II']]\n",

            "Ozhimuri (transl. Divorce Record) is a 2012 Indian Malayalam-language period drama film, directed by Madhupal and written by Jeyamohan and starring Lal, Mallika, Asif Ali, Bhavana and Shweta Menon in lead roles. The original songs and background score were composed by Bijibal. The film opened to critical acclaim but did not fare well at the box office. It was an official selection in the Indian Panorama section of the 43rd International Film Festival of India. It is widely regarded as one of the defining movies of the Malayalam New Wave.Ozhimuri is based on the story of the book 'Uravidangal' by veteran bilingual writer Jeyamohan. The title of the work refers to the matrilineal system that prevailed in the Nair community in the erstwhile southern Travancore. A prominent feature of the matrilineal system was that properties were enjoyed by successors of the women in the family. The women were educated and bold, with mothers often being stronger than fathers.  They enjoyed freedom in all respects. However, when the system was marginalized in the 1940s, women lost all their powers and soon became 'slaves' in the hands of a feudal male-dominated society. The movie exposes the complexities of a period of transition from a matrilineal to patrilineal society.\"Ozhimuri\" means 'divorce record' in both Tamil and Malayalam. In the matrilineal system, women were free to divorce their husbands if they were not having a sound relationship. The 'ozhimuris' or small palm-leaf pieces recording divorces of couples still stand testimony to the freedom, which women enjoyed those days.\n",

            "The story lays open the ego clashes and complexities of a period through the eyes of its lead character Thanu Pillai (Lal), who witnesses the tale of three women, his mother, wife and son's wife.\n",
            "Fifty-five years old Meenakshi Pillai who is married to Seventy-one years old Thanu Pillai files a for divorce against her husband and ask back the properties he had her transfer to him during the pendency of their marriage. Advocate Balamany who is the defense lawyer tries to convince Meenakshi and her son Sarath Chandran to withdraw the case on various occasions. Sarath tells her that his father was abusive and harsh towards him and his mother. And also tells her about Kali Pillai, Thanu Pillai's mother who was lord of a feudal family which followed matrilineal succession and had considerable power in the local politics and among people. Thanu Pillai was also very harsh towards his mother and even hated the matrilineal system and that's why he married Meenakshi who was from a Nair family which followed patrilineal system. Even though Meenakshi was from a poorer family Kali Pillai loved her and even advised her many times to take a stronger stand against her husband instead of submitting to patriarchy but Meenakshi remained submissive to her husband all through their marriage. Sarath and Balamany slowly develop a relationship.\n",
            "As the case progresses more and more things from the past are revealed from the perspectives of various people in Thanu Pillai's life. Meenakshi lived through these cycle of abuse because she knew that her husband deeply loved his son. It is also revealed that the only reason  Sarath is alive and in good health is because of his father. This reveal make Sarath change his view towards Thanu Pillai. It's also revealed that Sivan Pillai, Thanu Pillai's father was a wrestler who died penniless because Kali Pillai divorced him to live with a younger, educated man. This scarred a young Thanu Pillai deeply and causing him to be harsher towards his mother and become abusive towards his wife even though he loved both of them. Kali Pillai before her death ask Meenakshi to call Thanu Pillai but he refuses to see her, which causes Kali to storm out of the house and die in the streets. Thinking about his mother's death causes Thanu Pillai to suffer a heart attack later, that is a few months ago. After recovering he asks his wife what has caused his mother to leave the home and accuses his wife for hurting his mother and even calls her a slave. This deeply affects Meenakshi and that's what drove her to file for divorce. Who tells Balamany that she wants to live and die independent like her mother in law. Thanu Pillai suffers another heart attack but he is cared by Meenakshi and recovers. Next day in court, Thanu Pillai, Sarath and Balamany is hopeful that Meenakshi Amma will withdraw her divorce petition as she took care of Thanu Pillai when he was ill. But she insists in court that she wants divorce. A pained Thanu Pillai agrees to all demands of Meenakshi in court. On his way back home with Sarath, he reveals to his son that he was abusive towards Meenakshi and Kali Pillai because he was afraid of them due to his father's fate. He tells his son that Balamany is a strong woman and approves of their relationship, but he also advises his son to never be scared of her, and that fearing his wife made him try to put her under his feet always, which was a mistake. When they reach home, Thanu Pillai and Sarath are surprised to find Meenakshi at home. She had prepared a sweet dish and hands it over to Thanu and says she will come to look after him when he is not well, but not as a wife. Meenakshi who is now free woman now, spends rest of her life in the house Kali Pillai had gifted her, with pride and self-respect like Kali Pillai did.\n",
